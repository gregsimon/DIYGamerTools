# DIYGamerTools

This is an update of the DIY Gamer tools from Tech Will Save Us. The tools on their web site don't work with the latest 
Arduiuno editor. I wrote a new bitmap image editor which is minimal but still functional. 

Inspired by https://github.com/techwillsaveus/GamerArduinoTools

## Installation

If you just want to install and go -- then do the following:

1. Exit Arduino Sketch if it's open.
2. Copy Painter.jar into your Arduino/tools/Painter/tool/Painter.jar
3. Restart Arduino Sketch.
